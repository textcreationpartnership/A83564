            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Having now told the World what a Friend I have, I am further to tell my Friend what a treasure I have presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her, but that is so great that I am not able to expresse it, or if I were, you were not able to comprehend it: I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy but in part, and you can know but in part, so long as we remain militant, and therefore so as we are on this side Heaven, there will be a dark side as well as a light in that parti-coloured Clowd that reveales to us, and hides from us Christ and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:132882:6"/>
                  <p>Christ and Wisdom do stand in the Frontispice of this Structure like those stately Pillars <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz</hi> in the Porch of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 7.21. And as those signifyed stability and strength, so do these. Christ is the surest stability: The Apostle calls him Iesus Christ, the same yesterday, too day, and for ever. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.8. And Wisdom is of greatest strength, to which acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be given in triumph of Truth, Great is the Truth and will prevaile.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:132882:7"/>
                  <p>I know you have been long in labour of these lovely twins, Christ and Wisdom, as well as I; and to whom can they more providentially be set to nurse, than (as <hi>Moses</hi> to his own Mother) to you a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Israell?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the first Treatise I have travelled in birth that Christ may be formed in Soules, that a precious Saviour may be a precious pearl to precious Soules; And in the second I have been Wisdoms Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, which is no mean ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>

                  <p>If the Ambassadour be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so mean and obscure, yet the Embassy is of greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and will deserve well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come from the greatest upon earth.</p>
                  <p>Christ and Wisdom are the chiefest jewells, and most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant in the most imperiall Crownes; Such things as will greaten Greatnes, ennoble Nobility, and defend their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
                  <p>Your old Husband, my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friend, was so great a lover of Wisdome, that out of a greedy thirst after it, he set
<pb facs="tcp:132882:8"/> himself to the serious study of the Hebrew tongue when he was 40 yeeres old, and such was his unweary industry, that he dyed a Critick in that holy Language.</p>
                  <p>His most constant study was to compare our best Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Translation with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew and Greek Originalls, and he gave the Translators the due commendation of their faithfullness; but the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Languages were the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, or rather the two eyes with which he read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Baptisme</hi> is a seal of our ingrafting into Christ, and our implanting into the similitude of his death, buriall, and resurrection.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And <hi>the supper-ordinance</hi> is a Believer's seal of growth in Jesus Christ, a precious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of his precious death and meritorious passion, the very last pledge of his dying love. 1. Cor. 11.23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>In the same night that he was betrayed he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it and gave it to his disciples, saying. Take, eat, this is my body which is broken for you, This do in remembrance of me: after the same manner he also took the cup when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my bloud. This do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup ye do shew the Lords death till he come.</hi> In respect of this ordinance, as well as the preaching of the Gospel, we may say as the <hi>Apostle</hi> said to his Galatians. 3.1. <hi>Before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucifyed among you.</hi> This very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance doth more lively represent Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed than the most artificiall crucifixe or

                     <p n="6">6 <hi>The Assemblies of the Saints</hi> are to be had in <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>high Esteem,</hi> because <hi>God is in them,</hi> and there Christ hath promised his presence, that <hi>he will be with believers there</hi> in his Ordinances <hi>to the end of the world,</hi> and there the <hi>spirit shall abide with them for ever.</hi> We should <hi>wait upon the Posts of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms Gates,</hi> and flock to Christian congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>like Doves unto their windows.

Its that great Evangelicall grace that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as the <hi>unicum necessarium.</hi> 1. Joh. 3.2. <hi>This is the fathers command that yee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the name of Jesus Christ whom he hath sent.</hi> Its made the only Condition of the gospel-Covenant. Joh. 3.16. <hi>God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him might not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, but have everlasting life.</hi> Its faith that <hi>purifies the heart, changes the nature, renews the spirit of the mind, sanctifies the Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, mortifies sin, pacifies the conscience, satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the heart;</hi> Which is like <hi>a Soul</hi> to <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, praying,</hi> and <hi>all duty</hi> is but <hi>a dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case</hi> without it.

                     <p n="4">4. Love is a precious grace, and it hath God and Christ for its object. To take God for our Portion and Inheritance, and Jesus Christ for our only Lord and Saviour is the Epitome of all saving Christianity. And to love God and Jesus Christ so taken with the prevailing degree of our love being the touchstone of our sincerity. Love is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Apostles account made the all of Christianity Gal. 5.6. <hi>For in Jesus Christ neither Circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love:</hi> Not faith except it be working, not working faith except it work from a right principle, faith working by love. The more lively we are able with the spouse in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:132882:48"/> Canticles, to act love towards God and Jesus Christ, the cleerer will be our evidences, and the more abounding our consolations.</p>

Obedience is a comprehensive Grace, for if it be right it must be universall, <hi>denying all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and living holily, justly, and soberly in this present world.</hi> David gave evidence of his sincerity in this matter when he sayd, <hi>I hold streight all thy Commandements and all false waies I utterly abhorre.</hi> Ps. 119.128.

                        <hi>(i. e.)</hi> hate with uttermost hatred all that is evill, and cleave with uttermost delight and complacency unto all that is good, What the Apostle gives in charge to believing servants in order to their performance of that true and faithfull service which is opposed by him to eye-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I may give unto all the servants of God and Christ that will approve themselves to be sincerely his, against all dissemblers and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, Col. 3.22, 23, 24. <hi>Servants obey in all things your Masters, not with eye-service as men pleasers, but in singlenesse of heart, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God, and whatsoever yee do, do it heartily as to the Lord and not unto men, knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the

                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Brotherly kindnesse</hi> is another lovely grace. Its the cement that joynes together the Communion of Saints. <hi>Behold how good and joyfull a thing it is brethren to live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in unity:</hi> and Christ is the bond of this Christian brotherhood, in respect whereof <hi>believers</hi> are called brethren in Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the wicked and unbelievers are called bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in iniquity. It was sayd of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive believers that they were of one heart and one soul. Acts. 4.32. and those that are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all those obligations of onenesse. Eph. 4. <hi>One body, one spirit, one calling, one hope, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi> v. 4, 5, 6. The very name of Brethren should compose all differences, as <hi>Abraham</hi> sayd to Lot, <hi>let there be no division betwixt me and thee, for we are brethren.</hi> Gen. 13.8. Oh how prevailing should the name of a disciple be, <hi>When he that gives to a disciple a Cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple shall not lose his reward,</hi> Mat. 10.42.</p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:132882:49"/>
                     <p n="7">7. Meekness and humility are excellent and precious graces; and Christ was most excellent in these of any that ever were upon earth: it's true that Moses was said to be the meekest man upon earth <hi>(i. e.)</hi> compared with meer men, but not in comparison of Christ who was God and man, he was so meek that he was led as a lamb to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and did not open his mouth but only to pray for his persecutors. He commanded his disciples to learn of him those lessons of meekness and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Mat. 11.29. and saith unto his freinds, <hi>I say unto you, love your enemies, blesse them that curse you, doe good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you, that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven, for he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his sun to rise on the Evill, and on the good, and sendeth rain upon the just, and upon the unjust.</hi> Mat. 5.44.45.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Patience shall be the last; and this makes us conformable unto Christ, nothing more, wherefore the Apostle sets him before us as the only pattern of patience. Hebr. 12.1, 2, 3. <hi>Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:132882:50"/> Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, who, for the joy that was set before him, indured the Crosse, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him that indured such contradiction of sinners against himself, least ye be wearyed and faint in your mindes</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Patience is a gift,</hi> Phil. 1.29. <hi>Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake,</hi> and it was given to the Apostle in such a measure, that he could say, Rom. 8.18. <hi>I reckon that the afflictions of this present time are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be compared unto the glory which shall be revealed in us.</hi> and 2. Cor. 4.17. <hi>Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall weight of glory.</hi> And so much be spoken of precious graces.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the third place we come to give some instance in Duties.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Duty</hi> defines it self, for it is a tie to that which is due; It is a <hi>giving to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and unto God the things that are Gods.</hi> The Apostles rule is <hi>give unto every one his due, tribute to whom tribute is due, custome to whom cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, fear to whom fear. Duty</hi> is but a

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Hearing</hi> shall have the preminence, in regard the Apostle hath left it upon record that <hi>faith comes by hearing.</hi> Rom. 10.17. and what hearing is that that begets faith but the hearing of Christ crucifyed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Reading</hi> shall be another, and what do believers propose to themselves in the first place but the Scriptures, in order to that command of Christ, <hi>Search the Scriptures for they testify of me:</hi> They take true delight in nothing but what may further their knowledg of Christ.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>It's observed that of all the bookes of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scripture the book of <hi>Esther</hi> hath not so much as once the mention of the name of God in it, which hath caused some to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the Canonicallness of it; and the Jewes have a Ceremony that they will first cast the book upon the ground before they read it; and surely sound believers do stand much alike affected to all bookes which make no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, wherein nothing of Christ is to be learnt, they are fitter to be cast upon the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:132882:51"/> ground, and trodden under foot than to be read, and studyed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Meditation</hi> is another precious duty, and whither doth meditation carry the Soul? No whither more freely than to Christ, <hi>Oh that I had wings like a dove saith David, for then would I fly away and be at rest;</hi> and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would David fly, but thither whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he lookt, <hi>to the hills from whence he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected help;</hi> When the Soul is upon the wing of holy Meditation it flies as naturally to Christ, as <hi>Noa's</hi> tyred dove did unto the Ark. <hi>Come to me saith Christ all you that are weary and heavy laden, and I will ease you, and you shall find rest unto your soules.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Holy conference</hi> is another precious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and whither will that carry us but over to Christ: If Christ be <hi>our treasure, out of the abundance of our hearts our mouths will be speaking of him.</hi> We will be <hi>telling of his salvation from day to day, and declaring unto others what he hath been doing for our soules:</hi> How delightfully do men talk of their best freinds, how frequently do they inquire after them, and with the spouse talk with every one whom they think can give them any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of their beloved.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Examination</hi> is another duty, and what
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:132882:51"/> do they examine after. The very first Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is <hi>whether they be in Christ, whether they be the Children of God,</hi> clear that and clear all.

Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine your selves whether you are in the faith, prove your own selves; know you not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except yee be reprobates. The great Quaeres were whether Christ were in them and they in the faith?</hi>

                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Watchfullness</hi> is another precious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Of very great concernment and high consequence to Believers. Else <hi>Salomon</hi> had never given such a strict command, above all keepings keep your hearts, and why should they so warily keep the Cabinet, but because of the Jewell, because Christ and faith were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:132882:52"/> layd up there, and <hi>principalities and powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world, and spirituall wickednesses would wrastle for these heavenly things.</hi> Eph. 6.12. <hi>Be sober and watch, for your adversary the divel goes about like a roring lyon seeking whom he may devour.</hi> 1. Pet. 5.8. and our Saviour fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells <hi>Simon</hi> that Satan desired to winnow him as wheat, to what end?

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly</hi> consider that nothing must stand in competition with Christ for prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, for whatsoever we do value above Christ or equall with Christ we make our Idol, and if we should insteed of Christ bring our Idols with us in our seeking of God, he will at present answer us according to our Idolls <hi>(i. e.)</hi> as Idolaters deserve; and when we addresse to him in our distresses, we may have the same answer as the Israelites had, <hi>Goe to the Gods that yee have chosen</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>We must not prefer the World before

We must not think to make our services our Saviours, for this is to set up self and slight Christ, to make our selves our own Idols; We had as good be found in our sinns as trusting in our duties, and therefore we must keep close to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours rule, if we will keep close to Christ, who bids us, when <hi>we have done all, say we are unprofitable Servants.</hi> Luk. 17.10.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:132882:54"/> of being above ordinances, least we be found to be beneath grace; and that we need not perform duties, a peice of the strong delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of these times, that the Saints need not pray, nor hear, nor repent, it savours altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a legall spirit, and many such lawless songs which have been set by the Lazy Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians: They may as well speak out (as some of them do) and say that we need no Christ, we will not be beholding to him for Salvation. We must live in ordinances, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and duties like the week in the oyle, but still we must bear in mind that bodily excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise profits little, and ordinances and duties are but empty things, except God, and Christ &amp; the spirit do move upon them, they are the springs that fill those Wells of Salvation with the waters of life. Men must therefore be preached into Ordinances and out of them, so as to <hi>honour</hi> them and wait upon God in them, but out of them, so as to look through them, and above them, and beyond them, and to presse after Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:132882:54"/> and obedience be our Evangelicall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet we must know that we are rather saved through Grace than for it. <hi>For though death be the wages of our disobedience, yet eternall life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> And men must be preached into duty, and out of it; Into duty so as to do it and that with all diligence, but out of it, so as not to trust in it, knowing that our servcies as well as persons do need a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor that they may find acceptance with God.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>And lastly a Believer must take heed of Idolizing his Priviledges:</hi> Though Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reconciliation, Adoption, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and glory are high and excellent Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: Yet they are not Christs, they are not Saviours, some of the dreames of this age of delusion are to talk of injoying insteed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, as if men were tryumphant &amp; not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant.

                  <p>They are a part of the wisdom of God, being a portion of his written word and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will: They proceed from him that spake as never man spake, Jesus Christ the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:132882:78"/> word essentiall, and wisdom of his Father: And they are spoken in the defence of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom against all the gainsaying sons and daughters of folly in the World; and directed to the children of Wisdom. Therefore it will be our wisdom to incline not only our ears, but our whole hearts to the hearing and receiving of them: I might deliver my mind in wise <hi>Solomons</hi> words, who was sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named for his admirable Wisdom <hi>Solomon</hi> the wise, because he preferred a wise and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding heart above riches and honour, and therefore his wish being granted him, he ask'd wisdom, yea, he ask'd and had it, yea and had it so supereminently, that the World did ring of it in his lifetime, which brought the Queen of the <hi>South</hi> from far to visit him, and the Church hath rung of it since his death, yea, and all succeeding Generations will call him blessed, his memoriall being aeternized by those 3. admirable pieces of highest wisdom, his book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> the book of the <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi> and the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Songs.</hi> But that piece of his wisdom which I shall commend unto you is left upon Record, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? she standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the

Unto you, O men I call, and my voice is to the sons of men: O yee simple, understand wisdom, and yee fools be of an understanding heart.</hi> Hear, for I will speak of excellent things, and the opening of my lips shall be right things. In which words you have Wisdom speaking for it self, and speaking with a loud voice, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Pulpits, and house-tops, and high places; speaking from the press, and pressing herself upon you in the most earnest and publick manner, way-laying you in your paths, to catch you with guile in the indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of your Teachers, who become all things to all men, that by all means they may win some, lying at your City gates, and at your very doors, knocking in season and out of season for entertainment; to make short, she proclaims and commends such for wise and prudent that receive her, and brands, and condemns all such for fools, and bruits which refuse her, <hi>sed verbum sat sapientibus,</hi> I speak as unto wise men, judge yee what I say.

                  <p>The words of my Text are also found, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.19. and spoken in both places upon one and the same occasion: And they were occasioned by the morosity and frowardness of the unreachable Jews, whom no means could win upon, neither fair nor foul, rough nor smooth, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> came to them, clothed all in mourning, with a most sad, strict and austere gravity, as it did best become a Preacher of repentance, and they cry out that he had Divel.</p>
                  <p>And after the forerunner and harbinger, comes King Christ himself, but under the disguise of the Carpenters son, Christ he comes with all courtesie &amp; affability, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a most gracious and propitious remitter of sins, and they charge him to be a glutton, and a wine-bibber, <hi>a friend of Publicans and Sinners:</hi> Neither <hi>Johns</hi> austerity, nor Christs courtesie could take with them, neither wind nor sun, means fair nor fowl could prevail with them to lay aside their sins, and submit to the Gospel. This is intimated by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of childrens sports, of mourning and piping. saying unto their fellows, <hi>we have piped unto you, but yee have not danced, we have mourned unto you, but you have not wept:</hi> They would neither weep after <hi>John,</hi> nor dance
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:132882:79"/> after Christ; They had Copies both of mortification, and rejoycing set them by Christ and his fore-runner, but would write after neither, and therefore the Son and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth here implicitly call them fools in this disjunctive antithesis, speaking to this effect: <hi>Choose you whether you will hear, or whether you will forbear,</hi> whether you will receive or refuse that wisdom from above, that is communicated to the World by <hi>John</hi> and my self: But know this of a truth, that the Children of <hi>Wisdom will receive it,</hi> and they are <hi>the Children of Folly</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it: <hi>Wisdom is justified of all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. This word Wisdom is <hi>vox aequivoca,</hi> an ambiguous word, clothed with diversity of senses in sacred writ, to give you a taste.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Sometimes it is put for God the Father,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:132882:80"/> who is the Father of Wisdom, as well as the Father of Christ, and the Father of the Elect: He is the God only wise,</hi> Rom. 16.27. <hi>and the giver of Wisdom,</hi> James 1.5. <hi>and to shew the transcendency of his Wisdom, the</hi> Apostle <hi>saith, the foolishnesse of God is wiser than men,</hi> 1. Cor. 1.25. Wisdom is not a quality in God as it is in men, but part of his Essence, and therefore as he is <hi>love it self,</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. and <hi>light it self,</hi> 1. <hi>John,</hi> 1, 5. so he is <hi>ipsissima justitia, &amp; ipsissima sapientia;</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness it selfe, and wisdom it selfe: <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit fallere quia justitia, nequit falli quia sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia:</hi> He can neither deceive, nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, he cannot deceive because he is truth, or righteousness it self, neither can he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, because he is Wisdom it self.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Sometimes God the Son</hi> is called by that name, for he is his Fathers Wisdom, as well as his Son, in which respect he is also called <hi>the Word,</hi> Joh. 1.1. because as the <hi>Word</hi> that comes out of mans mouth declares what is in his heart, <hi>(out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaking;)</hi> So Christ came out of his Fathers bosome to declare his will unto the World. Expositors do give their sense accordingly of that mystical Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Wisdom hath built her an house,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:132882:80"/> that is, Christ hath built him a Church,</hi> and the Apostle calls him expressly <hi>Christ the power of God, and the wisdome of God.</hi> 1. Cor. 1.24.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Sometimes the spirit of God is called by that name, or something Equivalent, as</hi> Eph. 1.17. <hi>The spirit of wisdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>But most usually by wisdome is meant the written word, or revealed will of God,</hi> because it containes, and holds out the manifold wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God: Because it came from Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it selfe, <hi>and was given by inspiration from God.</hi> 2. Tim. 3.16. And its tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is to make wise: Its the true fruit of the tree of knowledge, <hi>fayre to look upon, and much to be desired to make one wise. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are able to make wise unto Salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus,</hi> 2. Tim. 3.15. The word is therefore Pro. 1.20. according to the Originall called Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in the plurall number, because it abounds with with all fullness. Ps: 19.8. and 2. Tim. 3.16. And is so perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat a directory, that <hi>nothing may be added to it, nor taken from it.</hi> Deut. 4.2. Revel. 22.18, 19.</p>

But I forget my self, its easie to be lost in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth of Christs Excellencies, and so long as I am not besides my foundation, I am well enough. In the 12th. of the <hi>Revelation</hi> you may read of <hi>a woman clothed with the Sun,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:132882:90"/> treading upon the Moon, and crowned with a Crown of</hi> twelve <hi>stars,</hi> and surely <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his royalty was not arrayed like this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull woman. I know you will readily turn aside to behold this strange sight. Know then, that this woman was the Church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a woman for three things.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Her <hi>Sun-clothing</hi> was the imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Jesus Christ, or Christ mystical, which believers are said to put on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14.</p>
                  <p>Her treading upon the Moon, is her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising, or setting light by all sublunary and terrestrial things.</p>
                  <p>Her Crown of twelve stars is the Churches enriching and beautifying with the doctrine of the twelve Apostles; now observe,</p>
                  <p>Though the Apostles writings are the Churches crown, yet the cloth of Gold that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:132882:91"/> she is arrayed in, is <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> Though the Apostles lie next to the foundation, or may be taken in as part of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, yet <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath still reserved this priviledg to himself to be the chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner stone.</p>
                  <p>And this stone is also a touchstone to try who are wise <hi>Master-Builders.</hi> Whosoever brings any other Gospel <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Whosoever layes any other foundation, let him be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Gal. 1.8, 9. Its doubled in the two verses, as if he had sayd what is sayd. 1 Cor: 16.22. Let him be <hi>Anathema Maranatha, cursed with a curse,</hi> double accursed. <hi>Babel-builders</hi> will content themselves with a <hi>Sandy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> But <hi>Bethel-builders</hi> will have a <hi>rock (the rock,) Or nothing. Super hunc Petrum</hi> will serve the builders of <hi>Rome:</hi> Upon thee <hi>Peter</hi> will I build my Church: But <hi>Super hanc petram,</hi> is the sense of the reformed Churches, they will build upon the rock <hi>Christ,</hi> for they will own no other foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Stand but upon this rock, or upon the Churches Mount, and take a prospect of the Enemies of the Church and truth, and you may easily conjecture that they are building a <hi>Babel</hi> by the <hi>Confusion of their languages:</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:132882:91"/> and on the other hand view the Orthodox, and you will find so much onenesse in their heart, and mouth, that its most conclusive that it is Christs spirituall Temple that they are raising: Why do the <hi>faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of England</hi> fight with beasts here (as <hi>Paul</hi> did at <hi>Ephesus</hi>) in the shapes of men and Women; but out of a resolution to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto bloud for the faith that was once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Saints?</hi> Why do the <hi>Gospells and Churches freinds</hi> shew themselves in the high places of the field against those men, and Women-Monsters that have militated under the names of <hi>Ranters, Quakers,</hi> and others, but that they are revolted into such a damnable <hi>Apostacy,</hi> that with their <hi>Heresies,</hi> and <hi>Blasphemies</hi> they indeavour to overturn the foundation. Oh that the Lords remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers would give him no rest, but cry mightily day and night against these crying sinns, which threaten to overturn both Church and State. Let us keep close to the foundation, least we be robbed of our Crown. Thats the Counsell that the spirit gave unto the Church of <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> Revel. 3.11. and the Apostle gave the same in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect unto the Church of <hi>Colosse.</hi> Col. 2.18, 19. <hi>Let no man beguile you of your reward, in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:132882:92"/> a voluntary humility and worshipping of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, intruding into those things that he hath not seen, vainly puff't up in his fleshly mind, and not holding the head, from which all the body by joynts and bands having nourishment ministred and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.</hi>

They will keep close unto the pattern of wholsome words, knowing that <hi>Heterodox</hi> speaking will soon overthrow <hi>Orthodox</hi> believing and living: Scripture tells them what difference was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>Sibboleh</hi> and a <hi>Shiboleh,</hi> Judges 12.6. and antiquity informs what a breach an <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Their indeavour is to speak out the words of wisdom and sobriety, that such as savour the things of the spirit may readily close with them, as with the true say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God. They will not, like the sons of Novelty, and Factors for Heresie sore so high, and walk aloft in the clowds, that none shall understand them: Those high swelling
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:132882:93"/> words of vanity, the spirit of God makes a mark of Heresie, <hi>Jude</hi> 16. They will not deliver themselves of such aeriall concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as shall amuse their Auditors, nor like the divels oracles speak with forked tongues, that you may well suspect them to be the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents seed, and walking with cloven feet, that you may say of them as Christ did of the Jews, <hi>Yee are of your Father the Divel;</hi> But <hi>the words of the wise are pure words,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, and such as become the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Gospel: I need say no more concerning this mark, but only give you the Assembly note upon that place, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12. That the Apostle by Gold and Silver, and precious stones understands pure and solid truths, such materials as <hi>Isay</hi> the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prophet, and <hi>John</hi> the prophetical Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist did lay down for the materials of the Holy City, the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and these are opposed to curious fancies, and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical conceits, and all such teaching as tends rather to ostentation and seduction, than edification, which are by him compared to timber, hay and stubble.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third mark whereby these sons of Wisdom are to be known is, that they are still driving on towards perfection, hear one
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:132882:93"/> of them speaking the sense of the rest, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Therefore leaving the principles of the Doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection▪</hi> Though there are some like a Mill-wheel, all the year in motion, and at the latter end at the same place, as in the beginning, alwaies lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and never come to the knowledge of the truth, yet this dwarfish stature, as it is no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, so no comfort unto their spirituall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: They count those hearers to be their joy and their crown, that thrive and increase in knowledge, and glorifie God by bringing forth much fruit, and stand fast in the faith, in the midst of shaking times, <hi>finis coronat opus,</hi> its the end that crowns the action, and therefore they are carryed on with a longing desire to be laying the <hi>top stone,</hi> that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of grace, grace, may be given unto it. They are still leading on their followers from grace to grace, and revealing righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from faith to faith.</p>
                  <p>You shall never hear them flattering men into that fools Paradise of being already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, its legal to be reproved for sin, and to be instructed in duty.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:132882:94"/> and seraphical Doctors; yea, they talk as if their Churches were like <hi>Alciabiades</hi> his Armie all Commanders, and all Teachers; like that monstrous body which the Apostle in derision of such a fancy, supposes, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.17. where the whole body is eye, and there is no hearing. This and such like is the language of false Prophets, and sons of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion and folly, and not the sons of Wisdom; and whensoever you hear any of these enchantments, wherewith deceivers go about to bewitch the people, then <hi>look to your selves that we lose not the things for which we have laboured,</hi> 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.6. We labour for your souls, desiring not yours, but you, if they are lost to you, they will be lost to us too, a great losse to us, for they that turn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to righteousness shall be graded in glory accordingly; but an invaluable loss to you, <hi>For what will it profit a man though he should gain the whole World, if he lose his soul?</hi> Surely the Apostle saith enough to awake any rational man out of that dream of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less perfection, when he saith, <hi>Whosoever saith he is without sin, is a Lyer, and if a Lyer be no sinner,</hi> he may flatter himself that he is none, but that place that is <hi>instar omnium,</hi> as good as a whole clowd of Witnesses, is

Wise Hearers are such as Believe, or Receive the Word; for both these may be well comprehended under one head; as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of Christ, and Believers in Christ are <hi>Synonoma's,</hi> and tearms that belong both to one thing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name:</hi> So the Receivers of the Word, and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Word are all one, <hi>Acts,</hi> 2.41. <hi>They that gladly received the Word were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and the same day there were added unto them about</hi> 3000. <hi>souls;</hi> Hearing attentively may bring the <hi>History</hi> and Notions of Christ into mens heads, but its the receiving and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of what is heard that brings the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery and possession of Christ home unto their hearts: The <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us that faith cometh by hearing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. and that <hi>without faith it is impossible to please God, Heb.</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:132882:97"/> 11.6.

And the <hi>Apostle</hi> on the other side notes, that the <hi>Word that was preached to the Jews of old did not profit them, because it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it, Heb.</hi> 4.2. That was the best ground of the four that received the seed into <hi>depth of Earth, Luke,</hi> 8.8. and that shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out those honest hearted Hearers that do receive the word into the deep of their hearts: If the bodies receptive faculty be not good, there ensues an <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Take notice therefore of this mark, and make it a touch-stone to try your selves by: Observe how earnest the <hi>Apostle</hi> is in pressing to it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your selves, whether you are in the Faith, prove your own selves, know you not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you, except yee be Reprobates:</hi> Its as much as if he had said;

                     <hi>Oh try, try, try your selves,</hi> whether you are in the faith: And <hi>David</hi> was as earnest with God upon the same errand, as the Apostle was with men, whereby it appeared that he desired to be <hi>a man after Gods own heart</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.23, 24. <hi>Search me O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my thoughts; and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting;</hi> Where he saith in effect, as much as <hi>Lord, try, and try, and try me,</hi> as if he would have all the three <hi>angles</hi> of his deceitfull heart put upon tryal. Be sure to take your errand with you, which is, that every wise Hearer, is a believing Hearer; And he that hears believingly, is one that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies Wisdom, he <hi>sets to his seal that God is true,</hi> yea, <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Wise,</hi> and <hi>Just,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,</hi> and many waies he glorifies God, and justifies Wisdom, our faith being our reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and our universal service: But he that hears the Word, and remains an unbeliever, <hi>ignorant still,</hi> and <hi>disobedient still;</hi> no change wrought upon heart or life; note that man for a foolish Hearer, he's as evident to be known, as a fool by his <hi>fools cap,</hi> or his <hi>fools coat.</hi>

                  <p>Oh that all hearers might be prevailed with to try themselves by this mark, and not to do it superficially, but thoroughly. I am
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:132882:98"/> confident that many figures of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that go for Professors, and are taken by themselves &amp; others to signifie much, would be found to be meere Cyphers, crowd as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them together as will fill a volume, and they will stand for nothing, but we may give up the count of them like beginners in Arithmetick; adde nought to nought, and it makes nought, take nought from nought, and there remains nought.

A second mark of wise Hearers is, that they retain the VVord, you may know who are retainers to God, by retaining his VVord; love the King, and love his Laws, love God, and love his VVord: No Lord Keeper so honourable, as the keepers of the VVord, for Christ the blessed of the Father calls them blessed; blessed, "yea blessed, yea rather bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they that hear the word of God and keep it:" The virgin was rather blessed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Christ in her heart, than in her womb, and if all Generations do call her blessed for the one; I am sure Christ himself gives her blessedness a rise, and preeminence for the other. <hi>A certain woman, as Christ was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lift up her voice, and said, blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked; But he said, yea rather blessed are they that hear the word, and keep it, yea blessed are the people which have the Lord to be their God saith</hi> David, Psal. 144 15.

                  <p n="3">3. Mark of a wise Hearer, or such Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as are children of Wisdom, which is; that they are such as practise according to the Word: Our principles and practises must be twins, and go hand in hand; <hi>Laus omnis virtutis in actione consistit,</hi> is a rule in Divinity, as well as Humanity: The practical Christian doth as far excell the meer <hi>nominal</hi> or <hi>notional</hi> thing, as the thing doth the Name, or the Power of Godliness, doth the forme: Our Saviour told his Disciples that <hi>except their righteousness did exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharises, they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> The Scribes had a form of knowledge, and the Pharises a form of Godliness, but Christs Disciples must have the power of both: You shall never hear the word promise much unto the meere hearers of the Word, except they be more than so; <hi>Blessed are they that hear and keep, as you heard before; and if yee know these things, blessed shall yee be if yee do them, Joh.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Revealed things belong to us, that we may know and do them, Deut.</hi> 29.29.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:132882:100"/> knowing and practising should not meet in the same men amongst our Hearers; as the ignorant and disobedient make the Epitome of profaness, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.8. So knowing our Masters will, and doing it, is the very summe and substance of our Religion; for they are not the hearers of Gods Word, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his will, but the doers that shall be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. As one saith of the 119. <hi>Psalm,</hi> which gives us an account of <hi>Davids</hi> pious practise; so may we say of the whole Word of God; they are <hi>verba vivenda non legenda,</hi> rules to be lived over, and not only to be read over, like lessons in Musick, that are never well learnt till we have practised them; when we can say with <hi>David, Lord thy Word is a lanthorn to my feet, and a light unto my paths; and we have cleansed our waies by ruling our selves after Gods Word,</hi> then are we good proficients indeed. Many think it a great matter to have the Bible in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, though they count a pair of Tables to be the more necessary and usefull ornament of the two; some think it enough to have the Bible or some good book sometimes in their hands, and if they have some confused notions of Religion in their heads, this is some great matter; But <hi>Moses</hi> taught

Deut. 6.6. <hi>These words which I command thee shall be in thy heart, and yet this</hi> Mark in hand carryes further, our <hi>heads</hi> must not only affect our <hi>hearts,</hi> but our <hi>hearts</hi> must also set all the wheeles of our <hi>Conversation</hi> in motion, <hi>only let your Conversation be as it becommeth the gospel of Jesus Christ,</hi> This is the <hi>unum magnum,</hi> what ever is forgotten let this be remembred, for thereunto we are ordained <hi>to shew forth his vertues, who hath called us out of darkness into his mervelous light.</hi>

So may Wisdom say, if I bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my self, and have none else to justifie me; my witness is nothing, my Father bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth witness of me, for God is Wisdom's Father, as well as Christ's. How hath God justified Wisdom even in our daies, by making errours to be but like a fan, to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the chaff from the wheat: Its necessary saith the scripture, <hi>that heresies should be in the Church, that those that are perfect may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and manifest, Nil tam certum est quàm quod ex dubio certum est,</hi> that is usually made most sure, which is made sure through many doubtings: As strong trees take deeper root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for being shaken of strong winds; so doth faith by distressing doubtings, though doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being in its nature opposite to believing, yet hath it such an accidental tendencie to the increasing, and strengthening of a Believers faith, that its owned as a maxime in Divinity. <hi>Qui nunquam dubitavit nunquam credidit;</hi> The oftner a mans title to an Estate hath been questioned, and disputed in the Law, and still carryed, the stronger is the owners assurance. The sun usually shines brightest when it comes out of a dark clowd, and so doth <hi>Truth</hi> when it triumphs after a victory gotten upon errour. How hath God of late
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:132882:113"/> stained the pride of wanton wits? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny loose opinions are already fallen to the ground before Truth, like <hi>Dagon</hi> before the <hi>Ark,</hi> and the rest are tottering.</p>

               <l>It<hi>'s</hi> like the Pills we <hi>sine quibus</hi> call:</l>
               <l>Physick that's proper both for fall and spring,</l>

               <l>The Church is stated here, the State is church't;</l>
               <l>It's from such times our peace will bear its date,</l>
               <l>When Christ's Church stands, and Wisdom sits in State.</l>
               <l>In such a Ship who would not Pilot he,</l>
               <l>Where each can guide the Ship as well as he?</l>
               <l>Many a fool large promises will make,</l>

               <l>Of such deceivers it is rightly said,</l>
               <l>Mountains are promised, but Molehills paid:</l>
               <l>Who builds a porch, and promises a house,</l>

               <l>He is the man whose promises though large,</l>
               <l>Is slow at making, quickest at discharge.</l>
               <l>Who would not hazard all in Church and State,</l>
               <l>Where Christ is Master, and where Wisdom's Mate?</l>
               <l>Come yeomen buy, your choice you'l not repent,</l>

               <l>What sad <hi>Benonies,</hi> will you sorrowing sit?</l>
               <l>And sop your bread in tears at every bit;</l>
               <l>That may have Wine and Oyle new from the Presse,</l>

               <l>Here's one that would be spent, and preach and pray</l>
               <l>For God and thee, and watch both night and day;</l>
               <l>That would most gladly compass Sea and Land,</l>

               </l>
               <l>Here's Precept joyn'd to Precept, Line to Line,</l>

               <l>From Pulpit and from Presse, loe here are sent,</l>
               <l>The two great Lights o'th Gospel Firmament:</l>
               <l>Hear me two words, the first for Christ the prize,</l>
               <l>T'others a word of Wisdom to the Wise.</l>
               <l>If we will not be hir'd with such a summe,</l>
               <l>Be you for ever deaf, let me be dumb:</l>
               <l>But I must speak, and speak, and never cease,</l>
               <l>For <hi>Zyons</hi> sake I cannot hold my peace:</l>
               <l>What Christ and Wisdom offer'd and refus'd,</l>
               <l>Gods bounty and his patience thus abus'd!</l>
               <l>Oh learn in Christs and Wisdom's freest Schools,</l>

               <l>Turn you aside to see this double light,</l>

               <l>Royal King Jesus sitting on his Throne,</l>
               <l>And Wisdom waiting on him, as his own:</l>
               <l>A fairer sight than this hath not been seen,</l>
               <l>The fairest Handmaid with a fairer Queen.</l>
               <l>Yea Christ that glorious Sun is such a sight,</l>
               <l>Out-shines the Sun when shining in its might;</l>
               <l>And Wisdom is so pure, I should not erre,</l>
               <l>To say the Moon's a Mole compar'd to her.</l>
               <l>Come buy you worldly Mammonists, pay fines,</l>

               <l>Here Christ and Wisdom are well met in this,</l>
               <l>They greet each other with an holy kisse.</l>
               <l>How we may make (alas that we could tell,)</l>

               <l>Schisme and Heresie would then look dark,</l>

               <l>This were the way, (and you would find it true,)</l>
               <l>To Truth and Peace to make old <hi>England</hi> new.</l>
               <l>Then Gentiles in their fullnesse would come in,</l>
               <l>The hood-wink't Jews would then break off their sin,</l>
               <l>Men then would set up Christ, give God his due,</l>
